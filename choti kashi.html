            <div class="history-text">
                Mandi, often referred to as the "Chhoti Kashi," is a city in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. It holds
                a significant place in the hearts of devotees due to its religious and cultural importance. The city, known
                for its temples, is often compared to Kashi (Varanasi) because of the spiritual vibrancy and numerous shrines
                dedicated to Hindu deities. 

                The history of Mandi dates back to the 9th century, founded by Raja Bahadur Singh. Over the centuries, the
                city developed as a religious hub, especially during the reign of the princely states. The architecture of
                Mandi is heavily influenced by its historical and religious significance, with beautiful temples scattered
                throughout the region.

                Mandi is particularly famous for its *Mandi Shivratri Festival*, a grand celebration held every year, which
                attracts pilgrims and tourists from across the country. This festival is a vibrant display of Mandi’s rich
                cultural heritage and religious devotion.

                The city is nestled in the picturesque Beas River valley and is surrounded by mountains, making it not only
                a spiritual hub but also a haven for nature lovers.
